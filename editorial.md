# Project: uber

## Overview
This project, “Uber_lite,” is a simplified ride-hailing platform inspired by the core concepts behind Uber. Users can sign up as Riders, request rides, and drivers can register to provide rides. The project architecture revolves around a set of distinct modules, each addressing specific functionality such as Riders, Drivers, Rides, Payments, and Ratings. 

### Purpose
- To give you a hands-on understanding of how a ride-hailing application operates at a fundamental level.  
- To illustrate various Python and web development best practices, such as modular design, API creation, database interaction, and data validation.

### Code Structure and Organization
The overall codebase is organized into the following modules:
1. **Core**: The foundation, providing app creation, configuration loading, and database connectivity.  
2. **Riders**: Manages rider accounts, onboarding, and profiles.  
3. **Drivers**: Handles driver registration and vehicle management.  
4. **Rides**: Processes ride requests, status updates, and driver matching.  
5. **Payments**: Encompasses the fare calculation and payment logic.  
6. **Ratings**: Collects and manages feedback from both drivers and riders.

### Rationale Behind the Design Decisions
1. **Modular design**: Each domain (Riders, Drivers, Rides, etc.) is isolated in its own package, promoting maintainability and clarity.  
2. **FastAPI**: Chosen for its simplicity, speed, and built-in data validation with Pydantic.  
3. **Separation of concerns**: Router files handle HTTP endpoints, service files handle business logic, and models encapsulate the data layer.  

### Key Technologies and Concepts
- **Python (3.8+)**: Core programming language.  
- **FastAPI**: Used for building the main Uber_lite API.  
- **Pydantic**: Ensures data validation for API requests and responses.  
- **SQLAlchemy (optional)**: Serves as an ORM to manage database operations.  
- **Flask + React**: An example usage demonstration is provided, showing how a front-end might interface with the Uber_lite API.

---

## Core
The **Core module** is where the main FastAPI application is initialized. It includes utility functions for loading configuration and setting up the database connection string. By isolating these core functionalities, you can keep the application’s main entry point organized and more easily manage environment-specific settings.

### How It Fits into the Overall Architecture
- **Single entry point**: The main FastAPI instance is created here.  
- **Configuration**: Core handles reading from environment variables or a config file, so other modules can use these values.  
- **Database Connectivity**: Generates the database URL that other parts of the application rely on.  

Below are the key tasks (and their conceptual approaches) within this module.

---

### Task: Create App
The `create_app` function is responsible for configuring and instantiating the FastAPI application. It typically includes the following steps:
1. **Instantiate** a new FastAPI object.  
2. **Include router modules** from each feature area (e.g., Riders, Drivers, Rides, etc.).  
3. Optionally configure middleware, exception handlers, and other application-wide concerns.

- **Inputs**: None (or optional configuration parameters).  
- **Outputs**: A fully configured FastAPI application instance.  
- **Expected Behavior**: Once called, returns an app ready to be launched.  

Conceptual approach:
- Import relevant routers and config.
- Instantiate FastAPI.
- Register routers with appropriate path prefixes (e.g., `/riders`, `/drivers`).
- Return the configured instance.

<details>
<summary>Hint: General pattern for Create App</summary>

A typical pattern might look like:

1. Parse or load settings/config.
2. Instantiate FastAPI.  
3. Add routers (e.g., app.include_router(riders_router, prefix="/riders")).
4. Return the FastAPI instance.

</details>

---

### Task: Run App
The `run_app` function (optionally) serves as an entry point to start the server if you’re not using a command-line approach like Uvicorn. This can be especially helpful for local development or demonstration purposes.

- **Inputs**: Possibly host, port, or debug flags.  
- **Outputs**: Launches the server process.  
- **Expected Behavior**: The function should keep the application running until terminated.  

Conceptual approach:
- Accept host and port parameters (or load from config).  
- Use `uvicorn.run(app, host=..., port=...)` or a similar approach.  

<details>
<summary>Hint: General pattern for Run App</summary>

1. Retrieve run parameters (port, host) from environment or defaults.  
2. Call uvicorn.run(...) with the created FastAPI instance.  
3. Keep the application running to serve requests.

</details>

---

### Task: Load Config
`load_config` is used to read environment variables or from a `.env` file to configure the application. This helps in separating sensitive or environment-specific data (like database credentials) from the core code.

- **Inputs**: None or a path to the `.env` file.  
- **Outputs**: A configuration object or dictionary containing settings (database URL, external service URLs, etc.).  
- **Expected Behavior**: Should parse all required variables and handle missing fields gracefully (e.g., with defaults or raising errors).

Conceptual approach:
- Validate presence/absence of environment variables.  
- Possibly use a library like Python’s `os` module or Pydantic’s settings management.  

<details>
<summary>Hint: General pattern for Load Config</summary>

1. Read from .env or environment variables.  
2. Construct a Config object with fields like DB_URL, SECRET_KEY, etc.  
3. Return that Config to be used elsewhere.

</details>

---

### Task: Get Database Url
The `get_database_url` function combines the logic of config loading with any logic needed to form a proper database connection string for SQLAlchemy.

- **Inputs**: Configuration data that includes database credentials, host, port, and name.  
- **Outputs**: A string in the format understood by SQLAlchemy (e.g., `postgresql://user:password@host:port/db_name`).  
- **Expected Behavior**: Return a valid database URL so that other modules can initialize models and engine connections.

Conceptual approach:
- Gather credentials and details from the loaded config.  
- Construct the URL string.  
- Return the URL or raise an error if necessary config is missing.

<details>
<summary>Hint: General pattern for Get Database Url</summary>

1. Use config vars (e.g., DB_USER, DB_PASS, DB_HOST, DB_PORT, DB_NAME).  
2. Format: f"postgresql://{user}:{pass}@{host}:{port}/{name}".  
3. Return the resulting URL.

</details>

2. Create or update rating for that ride-rider pair.  
3. Recompute average rating if stored in the rider’s record.

<details>
<summary>Hint: General pattern for Rate Rider(ride Id, rating, review)</summary>

1. Retrieve ride, confirm the driver’s association.  
2. Store the rating.  
3. Update the rider’s average rating if needed.

### Task: Get Rider Rating (rider_id)
Service-level function to return the overall rating for a given rider.

- **Inputs**: `rider_id`.  
- **Outputs**: The average rating or none if no data.  
- **Expected Behavior**: If no rating data, might return a default or indicate no rating yet.

Conceptual approach:
1. Query all rating records for the rider.  
2. Average them.  
3. Return the result.

<details>
<summary>Hint: General pattern for Get Rider Rating(rider Id)</summary>

1. select rating from RiderRatings where rider_id = ...  
2. compute average.  
3. return or handle zero records.

### Task: Get Driver Rating (driver_id)
Service-level equivalent for drivers.

- **Inputs**: `driver_id`.  
- **Outputs**: Driver’s average rating or none if no ratings.  
- **Expected Behavior**: Summarize the driver’s feedback.

Conceptual approach:
1. Query rating records for the driver.  
2. Aggregate/average.  
3. Return or handle no data scenario.

<details>
<summary>Hint: General pattern for Get Driver Rating(driver Id)</summary>

1. session.query(DriverRatings).filter_by(driver_id=...).  
2. sum and average the rating fields.  
3. return average rating.

</details>

## Testing and Validation
1. **Unit Tests**: Test each module individually (Core, Riders, Drivers, etc.). For example, test the logic of creating a rider, driver, or a payment calculation.  
2. **Integration Tests**: Validate that the entire workflow works, from sign-up to ride request, driver assignment, payment, and rating.  
3. **Edge Cases**:  
   - Attempting to request a ride without a valid rider or driver.  
   - Updating a ride’s status out of order (e.g., from “requested” directly to “completed”).  
   - Payment errors or insufficient funds (in a real scenario).  

## Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting
1. **Forgetting to Validate Input**: Could lead to database errors or inconsistent data.  
2. **Misconfigured Database URL**: Ensure you handle credentials properly to avoid connection failures.  
3. **Unclear Status Transitions**: If the ride statuses are not documented well, your code might allow invalid transitions.  
4. **Concurrency Issues**: If multiple drivers are assigned simultaneously to the same ride, you might need transaction isolation or a queue-based approach.

## Next Steps and Extensions
- **Real Payment Integration**: Connect with a payment gateway like Stripe or PayPal.  
- **Geolocation**: Use real mapping services (Google Maps, etc.) to handle distance calculations.  
- **Push Notifications**: Notify drivers of new ride requests in real-time.  
- **Refined Matching Algorithms**: Matching could consider location-based proximity, ratings, or driver availability.  
- **Advanced Rating System**: Include more categories or an option for riders/drivers to respond to feedback.

By following these sections and tasks step by step, you’ll gain a solid understanding of the building blocks for an “Uber-like” application. Focus on the conceptual approach and design; code details can be fleshed out as you progress. Good luck, and enjoy learning through this comprehensive project!
